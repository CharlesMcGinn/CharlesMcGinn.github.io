    <p class="desctext">July 26, 2020 || 24-hour duration || 1st Place Winner</p>
    <p class="desctext">Team: Charles (UI/UX, Animation), Emme (UI/UX), <br>   Jessica (UI/UX, Branding), Thuy-An (UI/UX)</p>
    <h2 class="titletext">Context</h2>
    <p class="desctext">In mid-2020, HackDuke hosted its annual UI/UX designathon: Ideate. Myself and a team of 3 other students joined together to enter the competition, presented with a prompt to pick a societal problem for which to create a digital solution.
    </p>
    <h2 class="titletext">Background & Motivations</h2>
    <p class="desctext">COVID-19 has disproportionately affected minority-owned small businesses in the United States. According to McKinsey & Company, this is primarily for two reasons: they tend to face underlying issues that make it more difficult to run successfully, and they are more likely to be connected to industries most immediately affected by the pandemic. Given this, it is more vital than ever to ensure that these businesses survive in the current circumstances. There’s a need for owners looking to gain exposure and find resources to grow, and for customers and allies looking to support more BIPOC owned, ethical, and sustainable businesses. We aim to address this problem by providing both consumers and BIPOC businesses a medium for connecting with one another, allowing individuals to find small businesses to support and startups to build their consumer base. We want minority entrepreneurs to elevate their campaigns while shoppers elevate their positive impact.
    </p>
    <h2 class="titletext">Process</h2>
    <p class="desctext">Meeting up on Zoom and brainstorming on Miro, our team utilized the first few hours figuring out the problem we wanted to tackle and the audience we intended to serve. Honing in on sustainable and equitable development, we determined that we wanted to create a solution for the barriers to Earth-conscious living and equity-conscious shopping. 
    </p>
    <img style="float:left; padding: 5px 50px 20px 70px;" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610af1884b73a13e55fe3cd5/610c32b80de6eb4ddc959782_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-15%20at%209.29.36%20AM.png" alt="Portfolio Item"><img style="float:none; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f3a0ab2a12ea8dfab15d237/600a2f56a05696c78c938f8f_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-21%20at%207.33.18%20PM.png" alt="Portfolio Item"><br><br><br><br><br>
    <p class="desctext">With an aim for accessibility and a drive for positive impact, we moved from the drawing board to researching a target user base. We decided that our stakeholders would be the many small businesses around the world that were sustainable and BIPOC-owned, especially those that could use a boost in support from their communities. The target audience of users then became those citizens and shoppers that wanted to be more conscious of their purchases by seeking out these types of businesses. The solution quickly developed into an app that would highlight and empower those small businesses to be found by people who wanted to more easily find them. 
    </p>
    <p class="desctext">The team then migrated our ideas to our higher-fidelity software of choice: Figma. We developed user personas to drive our creative direction, and built the branding and user flows off of that. Incorporating functionalities for account creation, content browsing, user interactions, activity personalization, and payment systems brought us to our final prototype.
    </p>
    <h2 class="titletext">Solution</h2>
    <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610af1884b73a13e55fe3cd5/610c329bea21cc4234470c95_elevate3.jpg" alt="Portfolio Item">
    <p class="desctext">Elevate combines the best features from Reddit, TikTok, and Kickstarter to provide a platform on which sustainably-minded BIPOC entrepreneurs can share their business ideas for crowdfunding. This application includes resources about conscious consumerism, increases accessibility to eco-friendly alternatives, and amplifies underrepresented voices in the business space.
    </p>
    <p class="desctext">Elevate eliminates influencer marketing by removing the ‘social’ aspect of competitor apps and instead focuses on the people behind the brand. The platform’s ‘Lobby’ includes an elevator chart where people can anonymously upvote ideas for businesses to rise up the ranks to gain more exposure. The Lobby also includes a daily livestream feature of a randomly selected business, where potential customers can learn more and back the project.
    </p>
    <p class="desctext">With ‘Elevator Pitch’ storefronts, businesses gain a dedicated customer base and the opportunity to be seen by investors, while also enabling customers to round up to the nearest dollar to back other charitable organizations.
